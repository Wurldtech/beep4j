- introduce thread pool to provide inter channel asynchrony
  - receiving messages
    - channel receives messages synchronously
    - channel receives replies synchronously

- callback interface vs. request object?

  - StartChannelRequest / StartChannelCallback
  - CloseChannelRequest / CloseChannelCallback
  
  - callback
    - executes immediately (from the callstack of the application)
  - request object
    - executes after the application code returns
  - we have StartSessionRequest and StartChannelRequest ...
  - ... but CloseCallback and CloseChannelCallback
  - some tiny difference: the StartSessionRequest is used to collect profiles
  - CloseChannelCallback#closeAccepted / closeDeclined
    - when passed to the application, it should be named accept / decline
    - because that's how our naming convention is:
      - callback methods are always named like event listener methods
      - action methods are named like normal Java methods, i.e. verb[object]()
    - for consistency reasons, we probably need a CloseChannelRequest
  
- SessionHandler
  - add method startChannelFailed?
  - add method exceptionCaught?

- ChannelManagementProfile
  - how to handle close and close requests of channel 0
  - method ChannelManagementProfile#closeRequested?

- support Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64, (quoted-printable)

- review of exception handling on callback interfaces
  - SessionHandler
  - ChannelHandler
  - ReplyListener
  
  - what is a sensitive action to these kind of exception?
    - abort session?
    - log and silently ignore exception? log into special application log?
    - ???
  
- general review of exception handling
    
- GenericSessionHandler -> SessionHandler
  - factory:ChannelHandlerFactory
  - advertisedProfiles:String[]

  - connectionEstablished registers profiles
  - channelStartRequested selects first supported profile according to list
  
  - maybe desired, wait for user feedback

- ideas
  - StartSessionRequest -> StartSessionEvent
    -> no, it is a request, not an event
  - StartChannelRequest -> StartChannelEvent
    -> no, it is a request, not an event
  - Session#close(:CloseCallback)
    - then we have SessionHandler#channelClosed and CloseCallback#closeAccepted
    - the same information at two places? maybe this makes sense, maybe not
    -> leave it as it is at the moment
  - tighter coupling between Mina and beepj?
    - could easily be reintroduced later
