- consider decorator style implementation for filtering on Channel interface
  - first, the state must be considered
  - then the chain can be called
  - so the decorator must be based somehow on the state classes?

- exception handling on client classes (handlers)
  - SessionHandler, ChannelHandler, and ReplyHandler
  - allow handlers to throw any exception?
  - catch exceptions and
    - terminate session?
    - delegate back to the handlers? e.g. ChannelHandler#exceptionCaught?
  
- Channel
  - add state to channel?
  - Channel#setAttribute(name,value)
  - same for Session?

- logging
  - add context: remote peer address, ...

- introduce thread pool to provide inter channel asynchrony
  - receiving messages
    - channel receives messages synchronously
    - channel receives replies synchronously
  
    while (true) {
      waitForPromotion()
      ChannelBuffer buf = fetchBuffer()
      giveUpLead()
      processEvents(buf)
      follow()
    }

- support Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64, (quoted-printable)

- GenericSessionHandler -> SessionHandler
  - factory:ChannelHandlerFactory
  - advertisedProfiles:String[]

  - connectionEstablished registers profiles
  - channelStartRequested selects first supported profile according to list
  
  - maybe desired, wait for user feedback

  
- logging
  - net.sf.beep4j.transport: logging of transport layer events
  - net.sf.beep4j.transport.DATA: all data passing through the transport layer


- next tasks

  - change internals to frame handling
    - API changes
    - support assembling messages in ChannelHandler or ChannelFilter
    - support preemptive ERR replies (reply to incoming message)
      - i.e. do not call ChannelHandler.messageReceived when premature ERR was created
      - see also section 2.6.3 of the BEEP specification
    - supporting receiving preemptive ERR replies seems not possible
      - message will already be waiting for transport in the ChannelController
      - there is no way to stop that (feedback from session to stream layer...)
    - ReplyHandlerWrapper must be a bit more conservative about completing replies
  - allow termination of Session (i.e. dropping TCP connection)
  - filtering
    - review ChannelFilter interface
    - write LoggingChannelFilter, just for fun
  - logging
    - context (channel number, remote peer, ...)
    - low-level BEEP logging
 
  
ChannelHandler
+receivedMSG(message:Object,reply:Reply)

ReplyHandler
+receivedRPY(message:Object)
+receivedERR(message:Object)
+receivedANS(message:Object)
+receivedNUL(message:Object)

- message is either a Frame, a Message, or an arbitrary application object

- create BeepFrameSequencingValidator
- replaces MessageAssembler
- validates the various BEEP sequencing constraints
- ChannelFilter / ChannelHandler / ReplyHandler can be sure that those constraints hold
